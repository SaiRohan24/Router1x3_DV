# Router1x3_DV
Router_1x3 Design and Verification using UVM_Testbench....

Designed to accept data packets on a single 8-bit port and route them to one of the three output ports the block level structure for the Router.
Implemented the RTL Design using Verilog HDL and verified using individual verilog testbenches.
Synthesized the Router blocks using Synopsys Design Compiler to convert into standard cells.
Static code analysis of the Router design is carried out using Synopsys VC SpyGlass Lint to conform with given rules/checks.
Its modular architecture allows for easy extension to other configuration with minimal modifications.
Rigorous verification using Universal Verification Methodology as it ensures reusability and portability.
